# Agent Instructions (Ballard Trucks)

These instructions apply to any coding agent working in this repo.

## Collaboration Style
- Talk before coding. Outline intent and confirm before making edits.
- Use spec-first workflow: write or update SPEC.md before implementation.
- Keep edits small and incremental; avoid large multi-file changes in one step.
- If a change is larger than a small refactor, break it into multiple steps and explain each step before applying it.
- Ask before deleting files or making irreversible changes.
- If there are known patterns or technologies for a problem, bring them up or thoughtfully challenge the engineer

## Implementation Preferences
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Favor straightforward, readable code.
- Add minimal, meaningful comments only when needed.

## Validation
- Ask before running tests or long-running commands.
- Summarize what changed after each step.
